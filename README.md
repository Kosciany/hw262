* [LM35 Precision Centigrade Temperature Sensor](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm35.pdf)

### How to connect it
When using the LM35, you must remove jumper J1 from the board and place the sensor on J4 like this:

To use the DS18 sensor, make sure that jumper J1 is on the board and connected like this:

## Schematic

## How to use the library

After downloading and installing the library into your IDE, use the respective header in your project. Then create a shield object by HW262:

```c++
#include <hw262.h>

void setup(){
  HW262.begin();
  HW262.display.clear();
}

void loop(){
  // Write your code here
}
```

## LED

HW262 includes 4 independent LEDs named d4, d3, d2, d1. The following snippet shows how to use them:

```c++
HW262.ledOn(D1_PIN);     // Turn on d1
HW262.ledOff(D1_PIN);    // Turn off d1
HW262.ledToggle(D3_PIN); // Toggle the state of d3
```

## Buzzer

The buzzer included on this board can be used like this:

```c++
  HW262.buzzerOn();     // Turn on buzzer
  HW262.buzzerOff();    // Turn off buzzer
  HW262.buzzerToggle(); // Toggle the state of the buzzer
```

## Potentiometer

The R10 shown in the earlier schematic is connected to A0, an analog pin from Arduino UNO.
To get the voltage level on A0 by potentiometer R10, use any of these methods:

```c++
unsigned char measure = HW262.readPinPot();    // Get value from A0 (0-1023)
unsigned char voltage = HW262.getVoltagePot(); // Get voltage on pin A0
```

## Switches
HW262 includes 3 independent switches named s1, s2, s3. But how to know if it was pressed?
```c++
bool switchState = IsPressed(S1_PIN);    // Read the state of switch 1

if(switchState)
{
  Serial.println("Don't touch this! - MC Hammer");
}
```

## LM35 Sensor
You can connect a temperature sensor LM35 by the dedicated socket shown in the earlier sensors picture. Be careful with sensor connections to avoid damaging it.

By default, the HW262 library initializes the board with LM35's features. Here are some usage examples:

```c++
  unsigned char measure = HW262.tempSensor.readLm35Sensor(); // Read value on A4 (0-254)
  float temp = HW262.tempSensor.measureCentigrads()/100; // Read temperature (¬∞C) with 2 decimals
```
If you omit */100* in the last line and - for instance - the real temperature is 23¬∞C, you will obtain 2300 as output.

## DS18 Sensor
After initializing the library, you can automatically utilize the sensor by adding this line to your code:

```c++
uint32_t temp = HW262.ds18.getTemp();
```

If you need to customize features of the ```HW262.ds18``` sensor, you can modify the sensor object using the inherited features from ```DallasTemperature.h```. ([link](https://github.com/jmchiappa/DallasTemperature) to library docs)

## Bluetooth & Serial port

Here is a simple example to use Bluetooth:
```c++
#include <hw262.h>

uint32_t wTime = 1500;

void setup()
{
  HW262.begin();
  HW262.display.clear();
}

void loop()
{  
  String temp = String(HW262.ds18.getTemp()) + "¬∞C";
  Serial.println(temp);
  delay(wTime);
}
```
Notice that you only have to use the Serial library from the default Arduino libraries. The HW262 library sets the serial port using HW262.begin() before it is used. You can connect any sensor with a UART port like this:
